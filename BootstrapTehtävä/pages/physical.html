          <div class="accordion-body">1. <span>Start eating at regular times.</span> <br> A regular meal rhythm reduces snacking, keeps your blood sugar steady and curbs your hunger. For most, this means 3-5 hours between meals; breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner and supper. <br>
            2. <span>Eat plenty of vegetables, berries and fruits.</span> <br> Vegetables, berries and fruits are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, as well as other compounds that are good for health, but low in weight. A good goal is half a pound, or about 5-6 handfuls a day. It is achieved when you enjoy vegetables at every meal of the day and put together your meal according to a plate pattern. <br>
            3. <span>Eat protein as part of every meal.</span> <br> It is advisable to eat protein steadily throughout the day, keeping hunger away. <br>
            4. <span>Choose carbohydrates from quality sources</span> <br> Bread, porridge, muesli, cereal, pasta and rice should be chosen whole grains. Whole grains are a great source of fiber and carbohydrates, they keep you saturated for a long time. Aim for at least half of the amount used to be whole grains. <br>
            5. <span>Drink water.</span> <br> Adequate drinking is important for the body to function and cope. It is a good idea to drink 1-1.5 liters of fluid a day and the best drink for thirst is water. Skimmed milk, milk or a vegetarian milk is recommended as a drink with meals.

            <span>1. Dive into the reason</span> <br>
            Think about why you're exercising. Want to look better in your partners eyes? Does your health need a fix? Or is the exercise your me-time, a moment to breathe? There are good motives and less good ones. The enthusiasm for exercise remains when the motivation is your own and personal. The partner's comment and the doctor's speech, on the other hand, will soon be forgotten.
            Your own motive becomes clearer when you think about what good exercise brings to your daily life. Friends, strength still after a day of work, or perhaps a longer surface? <br>
           <span>2. Find the joy in exercising</span>
            Everyone knows how good they feel after a workout. Sometimes that feeling feels unattainable. It helps to have a smile on your lips already during exercise. There are countless ways to move around. The way to produce joy for oneself is found by trying and remembering the good moments of one's own life and what produced joy in those moments. Was it music, beautiful nature, maybe a good company? A good mood arises in a sport with similar elements as in the good situations in memories. <br>
            <span>3. Check your goals</span>
            The goal is to encourage, as long as it is not too far away. If the bar is too high, the enthusiasm will surely stop. For one, the goal is to promise a gym once a week, for another to attend a running event. The latter already requires so much trick that the goal should be divided into intermediate goals. It is suitable to reward yourself with even new sportswear.
