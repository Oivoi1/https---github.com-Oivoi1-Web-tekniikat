          <div class="accordion-body">1. <span>Start eating at regular times.</span> <br> A regular meal rhythm reduces snacking, keeps your blood sugar steady and curbs your hunger. For most, this means 3-5 hours between meals; breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner and supper. <br>
            2. <span>Eat plenty of vegetables, berries and fruits.</span> <br> Vegetables, berries and fruits are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, as well as other compounds that are good for health, but low in weight. A good goal is half a pound, or about 5-6 handfuls a day. It is achieved when you enjoy vegetables at every meal of the day and put together your meal according to a plate pattern. <br>
            3. <span>Eat protein as part of every meal.</span> <br> It is advisable to eat protein steadily throughout the day, keeping hunger away. <br>
            4. <span>Choose carbohydrates from quality sources</span> <br> Bread, porridge, muesli, cereal, pasta and rice should be chosen whole grains. Whole grains are a great source of fiber and carbohydrates, they keep you saturated for a long time. Aim for at least half of the amount used to be whole grains. <br>
            5. <span>Drink water.</span> <br> Adequate drinking is important for the body to function and cope. It is a good idea to drink 1-1.5 liters of fluid a day and the best drink for thirst is water. Skimmed milk, milk or a vegetarian milk is recommended as a drink with meals. <br>
            <span>5. Train your willpower</span>
            Exercising is not always nice. Your legs feel heavy and your body is trenched in sweat. There is too much iron in the bar and the hebrick is easier than the new step patterns your trying to learn. Hard situations will turn in to a benefit, because overcoming them increases self-discipline and raises self-esteem. Your own efforts become valuable when you sometimes have to work in front of them.

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <span> 1. Always wake up in the morning at the same time.</span><br>
            If necessary, you can be flexible for an hour. The same rhythm should be maintained on weekends - especially if you have a tendency to have trouble sleeping. This way, your internal clock synchronizes properly every day. <br>

            <span> 2. Go to bed at about the same time in the evening.</span><br>
            More important than time, however, is to notice when you are sleepy and rested. <br>

            <span> 3. Make your life active.</span><br>
            Active work and leisure is good for sleep, as long as you don't go overboard. If you go overboard, you will have a hard time relaxing before going to bed. <br>

            <span>4. Leave work matters to the workplace.</span><br>
            Make an informed decision. At the end of the work day, you can list the most important tasks for the next day. The list makes it easy to continue working in the morning. <br>

            <span>5. Drink enough during the day.</span><br>
            Reduce drinking at night. If you drink a lot in the evening, you may have to go to the bathroom several times at night. <br>

            <span>6. Eat a carbohydrate evening snack.</span><br>
            For example, you can eat bread and fruit. Foods that are very fatty or high in meat may     interfere with sleep. On the other hand, hunger also keeps you awake. <br>

            <span>7. Do not use alcohol as a sleeping pill.</span><br>
            Alcohol can make it easier to fall asleep, but it impairs the quality of sleep and wakes you up in the morning. Continuous alcohol use causes a build-up of sleep deprivation. <br>

            <span> 8. Calm down in the evening.</span>
            Some relax quickly, others need more time to do so. Stop working and other work at least 1-2 hours before going to bed. The use of the telephone and computer, as well as spinning on social media, activate socially and physiologically. <br>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <span>1. Dive into the reason</span> <br>
            Think about why you're exercising. Want to look better in your partners eyes? Does your health need a fix? Or is the exercise your me-time, a moment to breathe? There are good motives and less good ones. The enthusiasm for exercise remains when the motivation is your own and personal. The partner's comment and the doctor's speech, on the other hand, will soon be forgotten.
            Your own motive becomes clearer when you think about what good exercise brings to your daily life. Friends, strength still after a day of work, or perhaps a longer surface? <br>
           <span>2. Find the joy in exercising</span> <br>
            Everyone knows how good they feel after a workout. Sometimes that feeling feels unattainable. It helps to have a smile on your lips already during exercise. There are countless ways to move around. The way to produce joy for oneself is found by trying and remembering the good moments of one's own life and what produced joy in those moments. Was it music, beautiful nature, maybe a good company? A good mood arises in a sport with similar elements as in the good situations in memories. <br>
            <span>3. Check your goals</span> <br>
            The goal is to encourage, as long as it is not too far away. If the bar is too high, the enthusiasm will surely stop. For one, the goal is to promise a gym once a week, for another to attend a running event. <br>
            <span>4. Lower the bar</span> <br>
            Wake up at five, at six to go to the swimming pool. From work straight to the gym, then home. Exercise schedules that are too strict and unsuitable for one's own timetable will end fast. Unless the person likes to be burnt out and have mood swings all the time.
            Boring but true: small changes are permanent. A very strict exercise program is the surest way to fail and go back doing your old habits. A flare-up leads to guilt and fear of another failure. Mere fear of failure can wreck new thougts of starting exercise.
